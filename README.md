🌎 GLOBAL LIFE EXPECTANCY ANALYSIS

About the Project
Life expectancy varies greatly worldwide—so what drives these differences?
In this project, I used R to explore how health and socioeconomic factors like GDP, education, HIV/AIDS prevalence, healthcare spending, and BMI influence life expectancy across different countries.

🎯 PROJECT SUMMARY

•	Analyzed global factors influencing life expectancy (GDP, education, HIV/AIDS, healthcare spending, BMI) using R.

•	Conducted thorough data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and statistical modeling (multiple linear regression).

•	Identified GDP and schooling as strong positive predictors, and HIV/AIDS prevalence as a negative predictor of life expectancy.

•	Validated model accuracy through regression diagnostics and statistical tests in R.

•	Results highlight the importance of economic and educational improvements, and controlling HIV/AIDS prevalence, to enhance global life expectancy.

📌 KEY INSIGHTS

•	Higher GDP and increased education levels strongly relate to improved life expectancy.
•	High HIV/AIDS prevalence significantly reduces average life expectancy, highlighting public health priorities.
