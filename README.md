🌎 Global Life Expectancy Analysis
🚩 About the Project
Life expectancy varies greatly worldwide—so what drives these differences?
In this project, I used R to explore how health and socioeconomic factors like GDP, education, HIV/AIDS prevalence, healthcare spending, and BMI influence life expectancy across different countries.
🎯 Project Highlights
🧹 Data Cleaning:
Thoroughly handled missing values, capped outliers, and ensured data integrity.

🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis:
Created vibrant visualizations—scatterplots, histograms, and boxplots—to uncover trends and relationships clearly.

📈 Statistical Modeling:
Built and refined multiple linear regression models to identify key predictors influencing life expectancy.
📌 Key Insights
✅ Higher GDP and increased education levels strongly relate to improved life expectancy.

✅ High HIV/AIDS prevalence significantly reduces average life expectancy, highlighting public health priorities.
