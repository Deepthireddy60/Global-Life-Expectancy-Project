Global Life Expectancy Project
About the Project
This project uses R to look at the factors influencing life expectancy worldwide. It examines how variables like GDP, education, healthcare spending, HIV/AIDS rates, and BMI affect how long people typically live in different countries.

What's Included
Data Cleaning: Taking raw global data, finding missing or unusual values, and making corrections to prepare it for analysis.

Exploratory Analysis: Visualizing the data using graphs (scatterplots, boxplots) to spot relationships between life expectancy and various factors.

Statistical Modeling: Building regression models in R to clearly identify the most important factors affecting life expectancy.

Main Findings
Countries with higher GDP and better education levels tend to have higher life expectancy.

Higher HIV/AIDS prevalence significantly lowers average life expectancy.

Tools
R programming language

Libraries: ggplot2, dplyr, caret, tidyverse
